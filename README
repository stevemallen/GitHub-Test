  110 events, starting 14:42 in PDV-FE (odd place to start! maybe the previous ones are lacking session id or are different??)
  User is on an iPhone (Safari)
  
  0. They hit IVO-FE /prove-your-identity/standalone-verificationservice
      ?Identifier:A2W-WEB&continueUrl:https://access.financial-support.service.dwp.gov.uk/authenticate/continue (14:42)
      
     This sends them to identity-verification-proxy to do standalone iv:
     
      /mdtp/confirm/proxy/9b6e3f3f-c0ca-411f-a8b6-7fb79aa6257f
        ?completionURL=%2Fprove-your-identity%2Fverification%2Fsuccess
        &failureURL=%2Fprove-your-identity%2Fverification%2Ffailure
        &origin=dwp-iv-standalone-A2W-WEB
        &confidenceLevel=200
     
  1. They do PDV (from a standalone journey) - session id appears here!
  2. Matching success (on NINO)
  3. They continue to do IV
  4. Can't answer any evidence sources (14:48)
  5. They try again
  6. They finally achieve IV success (15:03)
  7. They go back to IVO-FE (/prove-your-identity/verification/success?journeyId=9b6e3f3f-c0ca-411f-a8b6-7fb79aa6257f)
  8. They go back to DWP (https://confirm-your-identity.dwp.gov.uk/continue)
      This is the microservice.self.fallback-url in app config for IVO-FE
  
  two device ids (why??)
    mdtpdi#10f7b0a1-29ca-41ee-b38f-70aa794fe327#1652372442890_Ywnm+RFDfKQuZu7CV8M8cw== (63 events)
    10f7b0a1-29ca-41ee-b38f-70aa794fe327 (10 events - all explicit IV FE)
    
    Searching for the first device id around this time yields 5 more events (namely the bits at the beginning of the journey which were missing session id)
    
    
    
    IV-FE CannotAnswerAnyEvidenceSourcesQuestionsChosenByUser - 14:48
    
    IV-FE IdentityVerificationSuccess - 15:03  
      completionUrl: /prove-your-identity/verification/success
      journeyType: IdentityAssert
      origin: dwp-iv-standalone-A2W-WEB
    
    Looks like 2 evidence sources - tax credits, and passport.
